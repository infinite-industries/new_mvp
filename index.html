      Infinite Industries invites everyone to be challenged and enriched by the contemporary art experience. We believe that art can mean more than mass produced prints from big box stores. At the same time, powerful art need not come with a prohibitive pricetag. Each month we feature an artwork that is avaliable for a free download. We pair artwork releases with materials that help you learn more about the works and the artist behind them.

    <p>
      In "Tooth and Nail #3," James R Southard recalls the western history of Lamentation of Christ imagery by compositing a series of staged photo shoots with the artist's local friends in his mother's living room in Louisville, Kentucky. JR approaches this piece with honesty and affection, with each painstaking gesture held in a timeless arrest. Set in a personal space with unnatural, dramatic lighting, the rich, resulting hues are offset by items of modern existence: crutch, garden rake, cut off jean shorts. In this way, JR's photograph suspends action with memory, principles of sanctity with principles of design.

    <p>
      James R Southard was born in Kentucky and after completing graduate school in Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University moved back to his home state. He travels regularly around US and the world in order to show work and create his elaborate compositions through engaging a diverse set of communities. James has done a significant number of artist residencies, some of the most noteworthy ones are MASS MoCA, the MacDowell Colony, Vermont Studio Center, Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, and Seoul Art Space Geumcheon.
